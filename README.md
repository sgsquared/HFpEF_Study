The following code was built with the purpose of processing datasets, provided as individual tables, into a singular data table for further analysis. 

The code can be split into:-

    - SQL Code - for the querying of data tables and formation of our final data table.
    - R Code - for the analysis of the final data table including all preprocessing and machine learning.
