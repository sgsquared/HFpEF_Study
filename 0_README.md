The following code was built with the purpose of processing datasets, provided as individual tables, into a singular data table for further analysis. 

The code can be split into:-

    - SQL Code - for the querying of data tables and formation of our final data table.
    - R Code - for the analysis of the final data table including all preprocessing and machine learning.

Section 1 contains all the code required to import our individual data tables into MySQL.

Section 2 contains all the database management code required to generate our master table for analysis.

Section 3 contains all our data analysis code including clustering and classification algorithms.
